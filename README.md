# COVID-CT-MD
A COVID-19 CT Scan Dataset Applicable in Machine Learning and Deep Learning

The COVID-CT-MD dataset contains volumetric chest CT scans of 171 patients positive for COVID-19 infection, 60 patients with CAP (Community Acquired Pneumonia), and 76 normal patients. COVID-19 cases are collected from February 2020 to April 2020, whereas CAP cases and normal cases are collected from April 2018 to December 2019 and January 2019 to May 2020, respectively. Diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on positive real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test results, clinical parameters, and CT scan manifestations identified by three thoracic radiologists. Diagnosis for CAP and normal cases was confirmed using clinical laboratory tests, and CT scans. A subset of 55 COVID-19, and 25 CAP cases were analyzed by the radiologists to identify and label slices with evidence of infection. The labeled subset of the data contains 4,993 number of slices demonstrating infection and 18,416 number of slices without infection.
